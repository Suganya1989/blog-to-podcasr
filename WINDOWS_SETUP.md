# Windows Setup Guide

## Current Status
✅ **Basic functionality works** - Your app can generate MP3 segments and join them
⚠️ **ffmpeg missing** - Needed for professional audio processing

## Option 1: Quick Fix (Current Solution)
The app now uses `tts_windows.py` which works without ffmpeg:
- ✅ Generates individual MP3 segments
- ✅ Joins them into a basic podcast file
- ⚠️ Audio joining is simple (no professional timing/pauses)

## Option 2: Install ffmpeg for Professional Audio

### Method 1: Using Windows Package Manager
```bash
# Install winget if not available, then:
winget install ffmpeg
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation
1. Download ffmpeg from: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
2. Extract to `C:\ffmpeg\`
3. Add `C:\ffmpeg\bin` to your Windows PATH:
   - Open System Properties → Advanced → Environment Variables
   - Edit PATH, add `C:\ffmpeg\bin`
   - Restart Command Prompt/PowerShell

### Method 3: Using Chocolatey
```bash
# Install chocolatey first, then:
choco install ffmpeg
```

## Verify Installation
```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

## After Installing ffmpeg
Your app will automatically use the professional audio processing with:
- ✅ Proper 300ms pauses between segments
- ✅ Advanced audio manipulation
- ✅ Better quality final podcast files

## Python Learning Notes
This demonstrates important concepts:
- **Graceful degradation**: App works with basic functionality when dependencies are missing
- **Error handling**: Try/except blocks for importing optional dependencies
- **Fallback systems**: Simple solutions when advanced tools aren't available
- **Windows compatibility**: Handling platform-specific issues

## Current Architecture
```
app.py → tries tts.py (with pydub/ffmpeg)
       → falls back to tts_windows.py (basic functionality)
```
